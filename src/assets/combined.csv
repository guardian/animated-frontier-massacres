Then in a third engagement, the magistrate, Jacob Mountgarrett, ordered that a four pounder carronade be loaded with grape and canister shot and fired at the Big River people to disperse them. He then led a group of armed soldiers, convicts and two settlers in a charge ‘some distance up the valley’ where ‘more were wounded’ and ‘a fine Native boy’ about two years old was captured after his ‘Mother and Father were both killed’. Three witnesses recorded their experiences of the massacre.  Two of them were the leading perpetrators, Moore and Mountgarrett provided reports in the immediate aftermath.

Two different accounts of reprisal killings appeared in the same issue of the <i>Colonial Times</i>. The first account stated that: “The Military instantly pursued the blacks – brought home numerous trophies, such as spears, waddies, tomahawks, muskets, blankets – killed upwards of 30 dogs, and as the report says, nearly as many natives, but this is not a positive fact.” The second account stated that: “The people over the second Western Tier have killed an immense quantity of blacks this last week, in consequence of their having murdered Mr Simpson’s stock-keeper, they were surrounded whilst sitting around their fires when the soldiers and others fired at them about 30 yards distant. They report there must have been about 60 of them killed and wounded.” The official report of this incident however, said that “between twenty and thirty of their dogs” were killed and one Aboriginal “possibly wounded.” When the government agent, G.A. Robinson, travelled through the area in September 1830, a stockkeeper told him that William Knight was known to “kill Aborigines for sport.” Regional historian Shayne Breen believes that the accounts in the <i>Colonial Times</i>, relate to two separate incidents.","TAHO CSO 1/316, 15-37;  <i>CT</i>, July 6, 1827 - <a href=""https://trove.nla.gov.au/newspaper/page/679329"">https://trove.nla.gov.au/newspaper/page/679329</a>; Breen 2005: Ryan 2008: 492-3.",**,

The eight colonists were Henry Batman, John Wood, David Pitcairn, Mr Guy, Alexander Thomson, William Winberry, George Hollins and Michael Leonard; the four 'Sydney Aborigines' included Bullett, Stewart and Joe the Marine and 4 Port Phillip Aborigines included Benbow, Derrymock, Ballayann and Baitlainge. John Montagu, the Colonial Secretary in VDL, wrote about the incident to his counterpart in New South Wales on 18 August 1836: ""They came up with a tribe, consisting of men, women and children, to the number of about fifty to one hundred, and perceiving upon the persons of some of them articles which were recognised as having belonged to Mr Franks, a rencontre followed. It is not stated however what resistance the natives made, but none of the opposing party were injured, although it is feared that there can be little doubt that ten of the tribe of Port Phillip natives were killed. ""William Lonsdale, magistrate at Port Phillip from late September 1836, was instructed by the Colonial Secretary in Sydney, to investigate the incident, but none of the perpetrators he interviewed, would acknowledge the 'rencontre' although it was clear that each person interviewed had something to hide. Those interviewed by Lonsdale were: Henry Batman; John Wood; Michael Leonard; William Winberry. Winberry acknowledged that a party went after the blacks and that they were found and 'fired on', and 'several shots were fired', that a child was found 'belonging to the fugitives', but he did 'not see that any of the blacks were killed or hurt'. The murderers of Franks and Flinders were 'Callen and Dundom'. Leonard heard that 'some were wounded' but paid 'no attention to it'.",Cannon 1982: 41-52; Boyce 2011: 105-9; Rogers 2016: 275-85.,***,

He wrote: ""It is said that when the men came up with the blacks, the blacks called to them to come, they would fight them. There were, I believe, sixteen white men all armed and for the most part mounted. They fired from their horses; the blacks were down in the hole. They [the white men] were out of distance of spears. One old man kept supplying them with spears and was soon shot. Great many were shot. Some other blacks held up pieces of bark to keep off the balls but it was no use. Some were shot with their bark in their hands. The white men who carried out this massacre included John Coppock, superintendent of Yaldwyn's run and Samuel Fuller, Yaldwin's shepherd. Others included stockmen from Ebden and Bowman's runs. According to a sworn statement by Coppock, there were 8 stockmen in the party, that a pitched battle took place, in which seven or eight Aborigines were shot dead, the sheep being recovered the next day.

Charles Hutton's station on the Campaspe Plains, a neighbouring squatter, W.H. Yaldwyn called on soldiers and mounted police to search for the offenders. According to the official version of events, a party of mounted police, led by Sgt. Dennis Leary, under orders from Capt. G.B. Smyth, encountered a group of Aboriginal people about 112 kilometres from the place where Hutton's servants were killed. A pitched battle ensued and at least six Aborigines were killed. Capt. Hutton is recorded as having privately informed Assistant Protector E.S. Parker that nearly 40 Aboriginal people were shot; the entire group except one woman and a child. A later account by A. Cusack, the historian of the city of Bendigo indicates that when the sheep were recovered at present day Rochester, ""many had been killed, still more had their legs broken to prevent their straying and had to be destroyed. ""Hutton sent word to Captain Smyth who was encamped with a small detachment of troopers from the 28th Regiment soldiers, at Soldiers' Flat on the Campaspe near Barfold. No attempt was made to discover the culprits. Under Captain Smyth, the troopers rode down to Campaspe Plains, opening fire on the first Aboriginal people to cross their path. The chase and gunfire went on for half an hour. Six Aboriginals were shot dead and many more wounded. Justice was summarily dispensed on the Campaspe in 1839. The troopers rode back to Soldiers' Flat and an uneasy peace settled over the run (Cusack 1973:10-11). Hutton gained a very bad reputation for his treatment of Aboriginal people and tried to restore his reputation in a letter that he wrote several years later, to La Trobe. He denied that either he or his men had ever fired on the Aborigines. According to historian A.G.L. Shaw, Hutton said that the Aborigines had ""suddenly disappeared"" and died from influenza.",Clark ID 1995: 94-96; Cusack 1973: 10-11; Shaw 1996:134.,***,

There is an oral tradition that 40 Aborigines were slain in retaliation. On 22 May 1885 Francis Henty wrote to the Coleraine <i>Albion</i> stating that 'Murderers Flat' [sic] was at the junction of Bryan Creek and the Wannon River, and that one of his shepherds was killed here but that there was never a massacre of Aborigines at what had been known as Clover Flat. Henty believed the matter had become confused over the years with the Fighting Waterholes massacre at Konongwootong. Francis Henty was responding to an article by ""Vagabond"" in the Melbourne <i>Argus</i>, that attributed several Aboriginal deaths to Francis Henty. Two later writers, McGaffin (nd) and Bassett (1962), supported Henty's claim. However in 1969, Aldo Massola described the massacre in the following terms: The far end of Clover Flat, south of the Wannon River, was a favourite camping ground. While the blacks were holding a corroboree and feasting on some freshly killed stock they were fired upon by the settlers, using an old cannon loaded with bolts, nails, gravel and stones with telling effect. The place was afterwards known as Murdering Flat. As far as is known there was no grave; the bodies were put in the river. In February 1839, Dr G.C. Collier, who had recently been at Portland, wrote from Launceston to the Colonial Secretary in Sydney, alleging a ""most awful and atrocious massacre committed upon the aboriginal natives at Australia Felix by sheep and cattle herdsmen in the employ of Messrs Henty"", following the murder of a hut-keeper. Collier said that Edward Henty then set off with: two armed men and all the powder and balls that could be found at their stores at the Bay. Upon their arrival Mr Henty issued his edict, armed, equipped, and ammunitioned to I believe the number of 14 men. They proceeded to take, as stated by them, their revenge and fell in the evening with a hut full. Upon their hearing the noise of some footsteps the Aborigines came out and an alarm was given the whole, and as they came out they were shot, and those stockmen that had the firearms were found with a pole at the end of which a one-half of a sheep was placed, and some unfortunate mothers, with infants in their arms, crying for mercy, were perforated through. On March 25 1839, Governor Gipps directed Captain Foster Fyans, police magistrate at Geelong, to muster as many Mounted Police as possible and travel overland to investigate affairs at Portland. Fyans spent a month riding around the district, taking sworn depositions from all who were said to have been implicated in the events described by Dr Collier. According to Michael Cannon, ""unless perjury on a large scale took place, it appears that Dr Collier's allegations were grossly exaggerated versions of other incidents"" and that Collier's letters were designed to alert the government to appoint a police magistrate at Portland.",Massola 1969; Cannon 1983: 627-637; Clark ID  1995: 26-8,**,

The site was on the junction of two creeks, 12 kilometres from Bowerman's outstation. Sievwright found a small piece of cranium as evidence. He also reported that several huts in the district, including that occupied by William Allan, had Aboriginal skulls placed over their doors.</p><p>Davis and Braybrook were committed for trial for the killings. However, in the absence of corroborating evidence, the attorney general J.H. Plunkett, was unable to prosecute the two men for anything other than the misdemeanour of burning the bodies, and the men were acquitted.</p><p>The Rev. Joseph Orton presented the following summary of Sievwright's report.</p><p>Dated 17 April 1839:</p><p>Allen, the overseer to Bowerman, had instructed the shepherds at the outstations to inform him immediately any natives made their appearance that he might be prepared for them. On one occasion the natives did come and were quiet and friendly, but the servants having received peremptory orders from Mr Allen to inform him when the natives came, they accordingly did so.  Allen immediately ordered his horse to be saddled and rode in search of them and found the natives a few miles from the shepherds' station and warned them not to come near the station. (This incident relates to the massacre of 10-14 Aborigines being killed in July 1838.)</p><p>Allen left orders again with the shepherds not to allow the natives near. The men, however, said they were peaceable and they were desirous to keep on good terms with them. A short time after this the blacks came to the shepherds hut and under suspicion that they came to rob the hut an affray commenced and from six to eight Aborigines were shot by the white men. The bodies were burned the next day. It appears in the deposition that a native woman was in the hut with the white men. In answer to a question Allen acknowledged that he had ordered the men to protect themselves. Davies, a prisoner, shot most or all.</p><p>The above is the substance of the depositions and admissions of the implicated parties which is of course the ex parte statement. Allen was bound to appear when called for in recognisance of $200. In this case nothing more has been done than taking the depositions of the aggressors and murderers. There being no evidence but their own and that of the Aborigines – in the former case the accused cannot incriminate himself in a court of justice and in the latter Aboriginal evidence is inadmissible. Thus these miscreants elude justice and boast in their foul deeds – which accounts for the apparent frankness of their depositions (Orton 1841: January 12).</p>",Orton 12 Jan 1841; Cannon 1983: 643; Clark ID 1995: 89-90; 92-3.,***,

The devils had stolen about 100 sheep and driven them away to the ranges. When they got them there they broke their legs to prevent them escaping, and were killing them and eating them at their leisure ... We all mounted horses and armed with rifles set off in hot pursuit. It was early morning when we started, and about the middle of the day we came up with the black rascals, and a rare chase we had of it. The ranges were so rocky that we had to dismount and follow them on foot, and after two or three hours chase we got them beautiful- right between a crossfire, a steep rock on one side they could not climb, and rifles on each of the other. Well, we peppered them pretty, they stood up firm and stiff to be shot and dropped them one by one. We were expecting to cook the lot of them, when Mr George [Whyte], ..fired a shot too high and sent a bullet through one of his brothers face, ... we all knocked off firing and ran to him. In an instant the blacks were off, and we were too much engaged over Tom Park [Whyte] to think of following them ... We counted sixty-nine victims, including some half dozen or so that were not quite dead, but these we put out of their misery with the butt-end. The blacks carried off a few wounded ones but as we fired at the body we pretty well spoilt them all as we hit. 'Gippsland historian Peter D. Gardner has conducted a major investigation into this massacre. He considers that the Ngarum Ngarum balug or the Palug clans in the Dundas areas and or the Takallut balug, the Waitburuer gundigj and or the Yaninborer clans in the Victoria Range took the sheep not long after four of the Whyte brothers arrived in the Melville Forest area with many thousands of sheep in the winter of 1839 and before they took up the Konongwootong run in early 1840. They were accompanied by several stockmen including Daniel Turner, Benjamin Wardle, William Gillespie, Thomas Shilton and William Fox. Gardner considers that either Turner or Wardle or Gillespie later wrote the account in the <i>Gippsland Guardian</i>. He considers that within 24-30 hours of the sheep being taken, four of the Whyte brothers, George, William, John and James, and Turner, Benjamin and Wardle and three other stockmen set off in mounted pursuit. 'They came up with them at mid-day and then set off after their quarry on foot over rocky ground. After some considerable time the pursuit party came on the Aborigines who were either resting or had stopped in what they considered was a safe location.' However they were hemmed in on both sides and because they had not encountered rifles before, it was some time before they realised how lethal they were. Gardner considers that the massacre is at the Chimney Pots in the Grampians or close by.","<i>Gippsland Guardian</i>, July 6 - <a href=""https://trove.nla.gov.au/newspaper/page/11108468"">https://trove.nla.gov.au/newspaper/page/11108468</a>, 1860; Gardner 2010: 1-7.",**,

Having heard the encampment of between 45 and 52 Aboriginal men, women and children from three different clans in the gully on Emu Creek, Frederick Taylor and two squatters, James Hamilton and Broomfield, headed a party of shepherds with the intention of attacking them. As they approached the gully on horseback, the party formed an extended line with Taylor in the centre. They found the Aboriginal people asleep (suggesting that this was a dawn raid) and advanced shouting and immediately fired upon them, killing them all but 12. They afterwards threw the bodies into a neighbouring waterhole. One of the survivors, known as Karn, returned after the killers had left the scene and began to remove the bodies from the waterhole, placing them on the ground four deep, head by head. In the course of this he was discovered by some of the killers, who took him and his wife and child, to Taylor's home station, where he and his family were given provisions so that they would stay nearby and away from the waterhole. The killers then sent a cart to the waterhole and the bodies were brought up to the home station, where they were conveyed to some other waterholes and thrown in. Two further survivors, ""Queen Fanny"" and her child, were pursued to Wuurna Weewheetch, a point of land on the west side of Lake Mulhen Merri. With the child on her back she swam across to a spot called Karm, below present day Wuurong homestead, and escaped. Another survivor, Gangegamon, saw his wife and child killed. After the bodies were thrown in the creek, the water was stained with blood. Grieving for his wife and child, he remained near the gully for two days. Then Karn and a white man, Watson, appeared and asked Taylor why he had killed so many women and children. Karn, Charles Courtney, James Ranslie and James Hamilton subsequently made some fires and burned the bodies. Two days later, Taylor, Watson and Karn returned with a sack and removed all the bones that had not been consumed by the fires. Taylor disappeared after this incident and apparently went to India but later returned to manage a station in Gippsland. He was replaced by a man named Symonds who took Assistant Protector Charles Sievwright to the scene of the crime in January 1840. Sievwright also interviewed one of the Aboriginal survivors, Tainneague, and decided that between 20 and 30 Aboriginal people had been killed in this incident while Edward Williamson, overseer at the Buntingdale mission, believed that the number was 35. G.A. Robinson was convinced that an entire tribe had been eradicated. Squatter Niel Black bought this run in late 1840 because it was already ""cleared out"". Many of the Aboriginal survivors sought sanctuary at the Wesleyan Mission at Buntingdale and it is largely through the efforts of missionaries like the Reverend Benjamin Hurst and Francis Tuckfield, as well as Assistant Protector Charles Sievwright and Chief Protector G.A. Robinson, that so much is known about this incident. The next owner of Glenormiston station, Niel Black, mentioned this incident in a letter to T.S.

The culminating point of this policy was then the cook, who was in charge of the rations, either under instructions from his employer or otherwise, distributed to the Aborigines a mixture of flour and Plaster of Paris. Though this was a better mixture than the arsenic given them elsewhere in Victoria, we can imagine the ""damper"" which resulted. The Aborigines, to whom this act was probably the last of a great many indignities, speared the cook and helped themselves to the quarters of mutton hanging from the rafters. In retribution, McLachlan and his men caught up with the Aborigines at a waterhole on Middle Creek where they were about to feast on the mutton. The Aborigines sought safety by diving into the waterhole and there they were shot, one at a time, as they came up for air.

On March 8, 1840, they hunted down the Aborigines in the area, on the grounds that some had made off with 127 sheep. They stayed up late that night, preparing cartridges for their double-barrelled guns. Early the next morning the five Whytes set off on horseback with at least three of their shepherds –Daniel Turner, William Gillespie and Benjamin Wardle – following on foot, the tracks of their sheep to some low hills covered with tea –tree about 10 kilometres away. They tied up their horses, and crept slowly into the trees. Hearing Aboriginal voices, they crawled up to the edge of the clearing on the edge of a creek, where a meal of mutton was being prepared by a large group of Bunganditj [Nundadjali speakers?]. As the white men moved to surround the camp, they were spotted. The women and children fled as the men rushed to grab their weapons. A spear was thrown and the men started firing. Daniel Turner was speared through the thigh, and one of Whytes received an accidental gun-shot wound on the cheek, prompting the other gunmen to become ""savage to desperation"". According to the Whytes' statements, the Bunganditj [Nundadjali speakers?]  tried valiantly to withstand the onslaught, one of them being shot nine times before he finally fell. Dozens more spears were thrown in what the Whyte brothers later described as a battle that lasted more than an hour, but none hit their targets. There was only one Aboriginal survivor, Long Yarra or ""Lanky Bill"" who was killed a month later by George MacNamara, one of Francis Henty's stock-keepers at Merino Downs, on the Wannon River, near Henty. The Assistant Protector of the Aborigines, C.W. Sievwright was 9.5. kilometres from the scene at the time and quickly heard about it from Aboriginal survivors who told him that 41 of their clan had been killed. Realising that the incident could not be covered up, John Whyte decided to ride to Melbourne and make a personal report to Superintendent La Trobe. En route, on 23 March, he called in at Glenormiston Station near Terang and told the squatter Niel Black his version of the events. Whyte said that 25 Aborigines had been killed. When Sievwright, arrived at the station some weeks later, to take depositions from the perpetrators, he was surprised to find that the Whyte brothers and their shepherds freely admitted what had happened and that there was little variation in their accounts of the slaughter, except in their estimates of the number killed – between 30 and 80. A neighbour, squatter George Robertson who moved into the area three days later, stated that 51 Aborigines were killed. Fifty stolen sheep had been killed by the Aborigines, and after the massacre the bodies of the sheep and men lay all around, almost an equal number of each – ""the bones of the men and the sheep lay mingled together bleaching the sun at the Fighting Hills"". In Melbourne, the Crown Prosecutor, James Croke, pointed out that the Aborigines appeared to have been the aggressors in stealing the sheep and that William Whyte had killed two Aborigines only after a spear was thrown at him. Nor could Croke accept the depositions of the other perpetrators, on the grounds that it would incriminate them, and in the absence of independent witnesses, he could not charge the men. Once again the critical evidence of Aboriginal witnesses could not be used.","Journal of Neil Black 23 March 1840, VPRS 19; Orton 1840-2; Fyans 1842 and 1845, SRNSW 1846; Robertson to La Trobe 26 Sept 1853, in Sayers, 1983: Critchett 1990: 127; Clark ID 1995: 145-151.",***,

Barton said that the Aborigines had reported that Thomas Connell, a hutkeeper at the station had divided the damper among the Aborigines who were visiting the station. Soon afterwards, the blacks were ""seized with violent pains in the stomach accompanied by retching"" before they died. La Trobe requested that, when Robinson went to the area in early 1841, he would investigate the matter and, if there were reasonable grounds, he should apprehend the guilty party. When news of the poisoning reached the authorities, the Hentys sent Connell to Van Diemen's Land (Tasmania). Later G.A. Robinson tried to trace two Bunganditj [Nundadjali or Wulluwwurrung speakers?] who had reportedly survived by vomiting up the poisoned damper. But they had been 'dispersed'. On 3 June 1841, Robinson was informed by George Winter at Tahara station, near the Wannon River, that he had obtained from Aborigines the names of seven people said to have died from poison administered by one of Henty's employees. The Reverend Joseph Orton noted in his journal that Robinson was considering a case of several Aborigines having been wilfully poisoned by a shepherd at one of the Henty's stations. He noted from Robinson's account that ""poisoning seemed to be a general means to resort to put an end to the existence of these poor creatures"". In 1956, E.R. Trangmar, in his book, <i>The Aborigines of Far Western Victoria</i>, wrote: ""A man named Connell, an outside overseer, was employed by the Henty brothers. He had a hut on the hill above the ford named after him. He got his rations delivered by dray once a month from the homestead. The blacks used to wait until he was out on the run and then rob his hut, particularly stealing his flour, which they learned how to use. Connell got very annoyed with the constant raiding so he mixed arsenic with half the flour and hid the other half. When he came home in the evening he found the poisoned flour had gone and blacks were dead by the dozen. They had mixed the flour on pieces of bark and partly cooked it in little cakes on the coals and had ravenously eaten it. A raging thirst was created, the natives went to the river to drink and tumbled head first into the stream, they were thus drowned as well as poisoned."" It is stated that no graves were made, the bodies were put into the river. Connell hurriedly left the district and was never heard of again in these parts.","G.A.

Robinson of a “clash” with the Aborigines. Robinson reported the incident in his journal: Knowles said that he lost some cattle a short time since and went after them. He came to a blacks camp and they threw spears at him and his stock keeper. He thought they had his bullock. This attacking the camp of the natives under the pretence of looking after stolen property is a system that ought not to be tolerated, it is provoking hostility and would not be allowed in civilised society. The following day, Knowles told Robinson how, sometime earlier, Superintendent La Trobe had intended to gaol him for “killing natives”.",Clark ID 1995: 72.,*,

Robertson, who took up a squatting run near Wando Vale in March 1840, in spring 1841, Robertson was summoned to Roseneath station occupied by Mr Gibson accompanied by Mrs Gibson and the overseer Mr McFarlane and Mrs McFarlane. The two women were often left to fend for themselves and they made friends with the local Aborigines, including Yarra who could speak some English. Mrs Gibson carried a broken three-barrelled pistol for protection. When Mr Gibson's shepherd was allegedly killed by Yarra, Mr Gibson sought help from his neighbour Mr Bell and from John G. Robertson. Five men started to look for Yarra and the sheep which had allegedly been taken by Yarra and ten other Aborigines. 'After a smart ride of fourteen miles we came on the main body of sheep, but no natives. The sheep were nearly all dead; such wanton destruction no one but those who saw it can imagine.... We returned to Roseneath in the morning, buried the shepherd, and six of us started in search of the natives, but never found any of them for two days. I was out on the third night; two of our horses got away; one of them was mine, and I had to walk home, which I was afterwards very glad of, for the party fell in with an unfortunate native and ran him down, and I believe shot him in retaliation (and I have no doubt he never heard of Mr Gibson's sheep). On my way home I came to an out-station's hut of my neighbour's for a drink of water, and there was our friend Yarra, the native, chopping wood for the hut-keeper. I looked at him closely, and I saw a pair of Mr Gibson's old trousers he had on at the time all smeared with blood, whether the poor shepherd's or the sheep's I know not. I was only a mile from home, and there I found Mr Gibson's bullock driver with his team and two men, splitters from Portland on his way home. I told the bullock-driver what had happened, and that I saw Yarra at the hut, and if he could take Yarra on with him in the morning in his dray, he might perhaps tell who had killed the shepherd. They called friend Yarra, and easily induced him to go with them, but when he came in sight of the station he got off the dray and was running away when one of the splitters shot him. So ended poor Yarra. After this, there was a constant war kept up between the natives and the two stations [Dergholm and Roseneath] and, I regret to say, a fearful loss of life of the poor natives by two young heartless vagabonds Gibson and Bell had as overseers when they left.'",Bride 1983: 163-4; Critchett 1990: 247,**,

Seven men engaged in the stockyard [in the early morning] with milking were cut off. Only one of them was armed.

The Aborigines immediately dispersed and the men in the stockyards were rescued. With the aid of the neighbouring estates, a force of 40 well-armed men was raised and pursued the Aborigines, one of whom was captured and made to act as a guide.  Just as day was breaking the encampment was found and captured, the Aborigines fleeing, two or three of them being shot as they fled. The whole property of the tribe was taken, and a quantity of warlike implements, as well as all the booty secured by the tribe in their various raids.

In correspondence with G.A.

Of this they partook, and were immediately seized with burning pains in the stomach, vomiting, sinking of the abdomen and intense thirst (which are the symptoms usually produced by arsenic); on the following morning three men, three women and three children were dead. According to Watton, the bodies were burned, and he could not find any white witnesses. Despite the fact that Watton established that Robinson had received a large quantity of arsenic just before the incident, there was not enough proof to convict Robinson or his associates. On March 17, 1843, Supt. La Trobe informed the Colonial Secretary in Sydney of the reported poisoning at Kilgour's station, noting that attempts to discover the responsible parties had proved ineffective. The poisonings continued. When visiting the Port Fairy district in April 1843, Chief Protector G.A. Robinson was informed by a colonist named Hamilton that he had seen six Aborigines at a swamp near Tarrone station. They told Hamilton they were unable to walk after they had eaten poisoned damper given to them by some white men. In the company of Lt. Robert Chamberlain, G.A.

Years later, Scott's grandfather met some Aboriginal survivors who told him of the incident. It appears to have taken place during the trip by the surveying party who were in boats that may have been part of the remains of the wreck of the <i>Clonmel</i> and carried overland from Port Albert by bullock dray or built on McMillan's station as implied by Dunderdale. Gardner considers that following the murder of a shepherd at Lindenow station, 'an organised and co-ordinated drive' was organised by the owners of Lindenow and that it involved 'a boat with one of the <i>Clonmel</i> cannon mounted in its bow, and was probably manned by men from the Strathfieldsaye run....those driving across the land, on the west from Strathfieldsaye and the north and east from Lindenow, no doubt were directed by the ""notorious"" Frederick Taylor.'",Gardner 2016; Dunderdale 1973,**,

The lessee of the station E.M. Curr, told Dana that large numbers of hostile Aborigines had assembled on the south bank of the Murray River. They were ""daily threatening the lives of his men and attempting to take the sheep"". Dana proposed a plan in which his four black troopers would stay behind to protect Moira homestead, while he and three white NCOs would attempt to seize the tribe's leaders. E.M. Curr went ahead on February 1, with a bullock dray and sheep to act as a decoy. He succeeded in enticing many of the blacks from their reed-bed shelter. Before they could spear any sheep, Curr pointed out the chief named Warry. The white NCOs charged from their hiding place and seized him, despite the fusillade of spears thrown at them. The other blacks retreated to the reeds, where they ""kept their ground in a very determined manner"". When Dana pursued them, he was speared in the thigh, but managed to wheel his horse around and escape. According to Michael Cannon, there is little doubt that much more occurred than was revealed. When Assistant Protector Le Souef arrived on the scene a fortnight later, he found several Aborigines had been wounded by gun-fire, one so badly, that he was not expected to live. When E.M. Curr came to write his memoirs many years later, he recalled that Dana had shown him his report on the episode. The officer, thought Curr, ""omitted some incidents which I thought should have been mentioned."" Dana's hearty reply was that ""persons unconnected with the public service know nothing of reports ... being apt to blurt out statements more properly held in reserve."" On January 5, 1844, a man called Allan, called at GA Robinson's office in Melbourne and told him 'that a number of men also women were shot by Dana's party at the Murry [sic] and children were knocked on the head with carrabines <i>[sic]</i>.

According to Gippsland historian, Peter Gardner, he was murdered after a shepherd threw hot coals on the bare feet of Aborigines as a joke, although G.A.

It was at least the fifth murder of a white person in Gippsland within 12 months. An avenging party of 20 horsemen, known as 'The Highland Brigade' was organised by Angus McMillan, Lachlan Macalister's former overseer, and likely a close acquaintance of the murdered man, to look for the killer.

Everyman who could find a gun or a horse went after the blacks, and came up with them around a large waterhole [at Gammon Creek, east of Alberton] which was surrounded by the whites. They killed the blacks as long as their ammunition lasted [some say about half an hour]. Many escaped into the bush. Others sought cover in the waterhole, but often, as one raised his head for breath, he was shot. More than a hundred blacks were killed (Hoddinott in Bartrop 2004: 201). In reviewing every known account of the massacre in 2001, Peter Gardiner believes that the Highland Brigade went on a rampage through the district, killing Aborigines in five different locations. He believes they killed two family groups at Warrigal Creek waterhole and then a few days later, killed others at the mouth of the Warrigul Creek. At Freshwater Creek, they captured, brutally tied up and murdered a dozen men, women and children. They then shot down another family group at Freshwater Creek and repeated the same actions at Gammon Creek and possibly Red Hill. In all about 170 people were destroyed. Human bones have been found at each of these sites on several occasions.

Historian Marie Hansen Fels says that what Dana and his division did in the weeks between leaving Narre Warren and prior to the incident in December is unknown (Fels 1988: 188). But on December 21, Capt. De Villiers, who led another party of Aborigines and some white people, came upon Dana and his detachment of Native Police at the Snowy River. Dana told de Villiers that he had surrounded several camps of natives, and taken five prisoners, an old man, and old woman, and three children. De Villiers saw adult prisoners in irons, in Dana's camp. Later the Aborigines with de Villiers told him that Dana and his group had shot ""some"" of the Snowy River people. The next day the two parties separated, Dana and his group retracing their steps to the border police station and de Villiers and his party proceeding up the Snowy River. His suspicions were alerted by the unusual sight of a large area of trampled reed-beds and finding the dead and decomposing body of a very stout Aboriginal male, about 30 years of age. He had two severe wounds to the head and two other wounds, one in the leg and the other in the breast, which the blacks said were gunshot wounds, ""done"" by the Native Police. Upon his return to the Tambo River three days later, de Villiers heard from Richard Hartnett that local Aborigines had said that Mr Dana's party had shot ""some"" blacks on the Snowy River. James Warman, who had accompanied de Villiers part of the way, added further information about a carbine that he found, belonging to the Native Police, which was bloodied and broken, with tufts of black hair clinging to it. Corporal Owen Cowan, a border policeman who accompanied Dana and the Native Police, said that on December 19, that he had a hand to hand struggle with the Aborigines, that he was speared in the hand and knocked to the ground and that he had lost his carbine, fired his pistol, then regained his carbine, hit his assailant over the head with it and barely escaped with his life. At the time, the native police was split three ways around the islands and the lake at the mouth of the Snowy River and Cowan only had one trooper with him. They then rushed an Aboriginal camp but retreated under a shower of spears. The following night, December 20, he surrounded another Aboriginal camp and that he came ""upon it"" at sunrise. He did not say what happened next. Nor does he say whether the entire group of Native Police were involved, although Dana did say that he considered that this was the only way he could determine whether the white woman from Gippsland was with them. Fels is not persuaded that the incident constitutes a massacre because only one Aborigine was recorded killed and that the number ""became 'some' as the story was transmitted orally, and a slaughter when it appeared in the newspapers"" (Fels 1988: 193, 190). She does admit however that Dana's official report of the incident is now missing. Commissioner Tyers thought Dana did ""not act with prudence"" and Gipps questioned both his authority for acting as he did and his explanation – which was ""not satisfactory""; he acted ""with great want of discretion, to say the least of it"". Above all Fels appears to have overlooked the fact that a dawn raid on the Aboriginal camp placed the Aborigines in a defenceless position. This is what angered Gipps. According to historian A.G.L.

Following the killing of a shepherd named Edwards at Allen's station near Mt Napier, an armed party of colonists went out in search of the Aborigines. They came across a group of Aborigines camped at Coles' outstation, some of whom were alleged to have been wearing clothing that belonged to Edwards. The party called on them to surrender and then fired, purportedly in self-defence. As a consequence, at least two Aborigines were shot and others were wounded. Dr John Watton, medical officer in charge of Mr Rouse Aboriginal reserve said that the party ""acted under a magistrate's warrant and they say they fired in self-defence"". 3.

The party called on them to surrender and then fired, purportedly in self-defence. As a consequence, at least two Aborigines were shot and others were wounded. The medical officer in charge of Mt Rouse Aboriginal reserve said that the party “acted under a magistrate’s warrant and they say they fired in self-defence”.

The original information came from a shearer on the Murray, who, according to Assistant Protector Parker, ""stated in a neighbouring woolshed that a Mr Beveridge had 'settled' the blacks by leaving a quantity of poisoned flour in their way, and that numbers had been killed by it."" Parker despatched some of Aboriginal men at his Station to the junction of the Murray and Loddon Rivers ""to make enquiries"". They returned with almost identical information from Aborigines on Edward Curr's and Archibald Campbell's runs: ""they were informed that seven or eight natives had been destroyed."" The story fitted fairly precisely with rumours heard by Dr James Horburgh at Goulburn River Aboriginal Station. Horsburgh's opinion was that the Aborigines had either died of an influenza epidemic sweeping the Murray Valley, or that the story was ""an imagination of the brain of our worthy Seymour correspondent of the <i>Argus</i>."" Protector Parker was commissioned to obtain further evidence if he could. In February 1849 he was told by Aborigines from Lake Bael Bael that ""a number of the blacks of Tarrkgoonder tribe [the 'reed-spear tribe' of the lower Murray] have been poisoned some months since by white men at a place called Bapparrinok"". Similar stories came from other sources which Parker did not disclose. When La Trobe pressed Chief Protector Robinson for action, Robinson replied that the rumours seemed ""too vague to enable the Government to take any proceedings in the case."" When La Trobe pressed for more information to the Bench of Magistrates at Moulamein, north-east of Swan Hill, on the Sydney side of the Murray River, Patrick Brougham JP, replied that he ""certainly some months ago heard a report of the same [alleged poisoning], but took no notice of it, as groundless rumours have frequently been spread of natives having been killed.""",Cannon 1990: 230-231; Clark  ID 1995: 183,*,

Reconstructing from these oral records, Clark believes that the incident occurred in the early 1850s. It took place at a site known to the Kerup gundidj (more commonly known as the Kerreupjmara) as Murderers Flat. Rose Donker has recounted what she knows of the massacre. ""My grandmother was Hannah Mac Donald [later Lovett]. When she was small she walked with her brother Alfred and her mother from Macarthur to Condah Swamp. My grandmother was carried on her mother's back. They were looking for some place to live. They came to the Condah Swamp and there they found other Aboriginal people and families living there. There was a massacre there and they hid with their mother in the reeds until the fighting was over and then they headed off looking for somewhere safe. We were always told that Murderers Flat was where the fighting was. They were taken in and lived on the Condah Mission. I then understood they lived there as children, then as time went on they grew up there"" (Donker 1985: 18). In Jo Sharrock's reminiscences of Lake Condah (see Savill 1976), he refers to ""Harelip"" Johnny Dutton, who claimed to have been one of the few survivors of the ""Murdering Waterhole Massacre"", as a small boy. He hid in the water among the reeds. This suggests this is a reference to the same massacre recorded by Donker.",Savill 1972[?]; Donker 1985: 18; Cark ID 1995: 52.,**,

The latter soon discovered that the stock had been driven in the direction of the mountains by the Blacks. After following the tracks for about 8 miles, they came to a precipitous rock, where they turned down a creek, on the sides of which they discovered from 200-300 Blacks busily engaged in roasting mutton. The instant they perceived Mr. Freer and his party they took to their spears and boomerangs, retiring to the ranges, but on discovering the weakness of their pursuers, endeavoured to surround them, threatening them and abusing them in tolerable English while daring them to … come on. The party being badly armed, Sgt Freer prudently retired, and travelling all night he reached a station of a Mr Steel (evidently Towel Creek) where he was furnished with the assistance of three horsemen. Upon returning to the place he last saw the Blacks, here they found the remains of about 60 sheep and 3 yards most ingeniously constructed.  Following their trail, Mr Freer and party proceeded about 12 miles up Kundering Brook, where they found the Blacks had turned across the Mountains. Continuing the trail, the party ultimately found the Blacks in the act of preparing a meal of mutton and upon being fired upon they speedily decamped, but without 220 sheep which were still alive.’  It is stated that the owners of the sheep were Messrs. Betts and Panton, who were at the time occupiers of Long Flat station on the Macleay River.

The settlers had an Aboriginal servant working for them called Jimmy Taylor who had acquired a sufficient knowledge of English to become aware of what was going to happen. That night he went to the camp to warn his tribesmen and they immediately moved camp upstream and took shelter in a rain forest,' some climbing to the tops of trees and laying down in the thick matted vines covering the tree tops, while others continued on towards the tableland. It would appear that  Jack Scott’s mother tried to hide in the same bushes so fell an easy victim to the hunters. Unfortunately for those hiding in the vines, one man coughed. This at once betrayed their hiding place with disastrous results. It is doubtful if there is any record of how many lost their lives at Towel Creek.

His body was dismembered in a practice performed by the Ngarnji tribe ‘for particularly violent men, to prevent their spirit from continuing to perform evil deeds.’ ",Reprisal,Reprisal for killing civilian(s),Spears & firearms,,"After Lenehan’s death, Sir John Cockburn, minister for the Northern Territory in the Downer government, ordered Constable William Curtis and five native police based at the Roper River to investigate. They met with the station manager, Tom Lynott, and 15 stockmen, including the notorious Tommy Campbell. Aboriginal stockmen from Queensland, whose tracking skills were highly valuable, were also present.
Six years later (1892), a massacre occurred on top of the Abner Range, 100km from where Lenehan had been killed, where the party of 22 went after about “70 or 80 fleeing Aboriginals.”
The fleeing group went to the top of the Abner Range, thinking the horses would not be able to reach the top. The horsemen did find a way to the top and followed the tracks left behind to an Aboriginal camp. 
Roberts: 
“The men, in pairs, formed a half-circle around the sleeping camp – some of them as close as 20 metres. On the far side of the camp was a sheer, 150-metre drop. The numerous small fires were evidence of a large number of people. Curtis said he would fire first, as soon as it was light enough to see. Shooting sleeping victims at first light was a standard method. Exhausted, the occupants of the camp slept soundly. But, at times, according to Gaunt, “we could hear a piccaninny cry and the lubra crooning to it.” When it was finally light enough to see, an Aboriginal man sat up and stretched his arms.
‘Smith fired and the police boy with me fired at the sitting Abo. The black bounced off the ground and fell over into the fire, stone dead. Then pandemonium started. Blacks were rushing to all points only to be driven back with a deadly fire … One big Abo, over six feet, rushed toward the boy and I. I dropped him in his tracks with a well-directed shot. Later on, when we went through the camp to count the dead and despatch the wounded, I walked over to this big Abo and was astonished to find, instead of a buck, that it was a splendidly built young lubra about, I should judge, sixteen or eighteen years of age. The bullet had struck her on the bridge of the nose and penetrated to the brain. She never knew what hit her … When the melee was over we counted fifty-two dead and mortally wounded. For mercy’s sake, we despatched the wounded. Twelve more we found at the foot of the cliff fearfully mangled.’
Below the cliff was the head of a creek, which Tom Lynott named Malakoff Creek, after a bloody battle during the siege of Sevastopol in the Crimean War. When a camp was attacked in daylight, the whites were usually mounted and, unless the country was open and flat, it was often possible for a number of occupants to escape. In some cases they watched in horror, unseen, as whites dispatched the wounded. Adults and children received a bullet to the brain, while babies – whether injured or not – were held by the ankles “just like goanna”, their skulls smashed against trees or rocks. A crying baby left behind when Garrwa people fled a camp on the Robinson River was thrown onto the hot coals of a cooking fire, still crying.”

There is strong evidence that it was intended to intimidate the Pinjara in preperation to build a settlement in the area. On October 15th, an article published in the Perth Gazzette revealed that the Governor James Sitrlining intended to explore the country between the Murray and Mount Willliam, which covered Pinjarra. Governor James Stirling explcitily stated his intention to intimidate the indigenous peoples before inhabiting the area, in a letter to the Colonial Office. In the letter Stirling expressess his concern that surrounding clans could allign and drive out the settlers. ""They threatened after the murder in July [Nisbett] to burn the barracks and house on the Murray and destroy all the whites in their district. There was danger their success in this species of warefare, might tempt other tribes to pursue the same course, and eventually combine together for the extermination of the whites. it therefore became of the most urgent neccesssity that a check should be put upon the career of that particular tribe perceiving this, I availed myself of the first occasion to proceed that quarter.""  At the end of the hostilities, Stirling gave the Noongar people a terrifying warning. If there were any retaliatory payback killings from the Binjareb, he declared, ""no one would be allowed to remain alive on this side of the Mountains""","It can be argued that the Pinjarra Massacre, contrasting with the Fremantle and many others, was not essentially retribution but preperation to build a settlment in the area. Nisbett, a servant to Lieutenant Armstrong and Baron, a dischargee from the 63rd Regiment, were on an expedition to recover a horse, when Nisbett was killed and Baron speared three times.

There was danger their success in this species of warefare, might tempt other tribes to pursue the same course, and eventually combine together for the extermination of the whites. it therefore became of the most urgent neccesssity that a check should be put upon the career of that particular tribe perceiving this, I availed myself of the first occasion to proceed that quarter.""

There is evidence that the Police searched for Banjo on horseback in October 1922, but there is no official documentation for the next few days after they sent out their search party.

Sturt Creek station is located in Sturt Creek valley, which was accessed by a number of language groups (Jaru, Walmajarri and Gugadja) located adjacent to the area. It was an important spot where they would share in the resources (water, plants, wildlife) and sacred sites (pools used for initiations such as Myarra pool). This could be linked back to the broader effect that colonisation has had on Aboriginal culture and their ability to preserve sacred cultural practices. Also important to note that an area that was once have known fondly as a place for a number of clans to access resoruces and practice their culture is now known as a site of horrific violence. Relevant to Lidia Thrope's recent quote- these events may seem like a long time ago, but our people continue to carry this pain with us every day.","The Police set out to find Banjo and killed many Aboriginal people at Sturt Creek as a result of  the deaths of the two white stockmen. Oral testimonies state that when the police ran out of bullets, they chained the remaining Aboriginal survivors and brought them to another area near the Denison Downs Homestead, where they were later shot. An Aboriginal man and his son escaped, they ran and swam across a nearby river while police shot at them. The Police left no other survivors- even the cooks were said to have been killed. The Police then burned all of the bodies. The Oral history is based on these survivors' accounts. An archaelogical study (led by Dr Pamela Smith) found many human remains at the site of the massacre. An examination of the remains showed that these bones had been burned at exceptionally high temperatures in a large fire. ","Report by Dr Pamela Smith, an Archaelogist from Flinders University who has done extensive research on the history of Sturt Creek massacre and excavated the site, finding physical evidence taht supports many of the claims made in oral testimonies.
